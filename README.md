# COVID-19 SIHR-Model
#### Supervised by: Mr. Laurent Dumas.
#### In Partnership with: Mohammed Abdallah.
#### Course: Derivative-Free Optimization.
#### Programming Language: Python.

## Description
We modeled the COVID-19 epidemy with a SIHR model fitted with the real French data during *March - June, 2020*. We used an **inverse type** problem and Derivative-Free Optimization **(DFO)** algorithms such as Nelder-Mead and NEWUOA to minimize a specific function.
